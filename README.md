# [Snakeish](https://snakeish.vercel.app)
I like snake game and multiplayer, so im trying to combine those two into one funny game!

## How it works?
I used here Next.js with styled-components for frontend. To make multiplayer, i used library Socket.io. The backend is [here](https://github.com/Oskar-Przyborski/snakeish-backend).
